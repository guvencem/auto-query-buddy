I don't have access to the original content of `MembershipDialog.tsx`, so I cannot reconstruct the full file by replacing the `// ... keep existing code` comments. I can only see the parts that were shown in the conversation, which only included a small snippet about `handlePremiumClick`.

To help you properly, please share the original content of `src/components/dialogs/MembershipDialog.tsx` and I'll help you integrate the changes while preserving all the necessary code.
